# Python and Data Science Basics Repository

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains resources and projects from my summer bootcamp, where I have learned and applied various concepts in Python, SQL, and data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. I will continue to update this repository with more projects in the future.

## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of my work and learning progress in Python and data science. It includes tutorials and examples on:
- Python programming
- SQL database management
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Data manipulation using NumPy and pandas

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: General-purpose programming language
- **SQL**: Database management
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib
- **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library
- **Tkinter**: Standard GUI library for Python

## Contents
- `python_basics/`: Basics of Python programming
- `sql_basics/`: Basics of SQL
- `seaborn_tutorials/`: Examples and tutorials for Seaborn
- `matplotlib_tutorials/`: Examples and tutorials for Matplotlib
- `numpy_tutorials/`: Examples and tutorials for NumPy

## Projects
### Zomato Application
This project is a simulation of the Zomato food delivery app. It was built using Python, SQL, Tkinter, and Python-SQL connectivity. Key features include:
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration system
- **Profile Management**: View and edit user profiles
- **Restaurant Listings**: Display and search for restaurants
- **Order Management**: Place and manage orders

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- SQL
- Tkinter
- Python-SQL connectivity

**Directory Structure**:
- `zomato_app/`
  - `main.py`: Main application file
  - `db/`: Database scripts and schema
  - `ui/`: User interface components
    
### Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn patterns in a telecommunications company, focusing on various factors that influence customer retention.

**Table of Contents**:
1. Introduction
2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Univariate Analysis
5. Bivariate Analysis
6. Multivariate Analysis
7. Conclusions

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive analysis of customer churn factors
- Visualization of churn patterns using various plots (histograms, bar plots, violin plots, etc.)
- In-depth examination of relationships between different variables and churn

**Technologies Used**:
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Key Findings**:
- Higher churn rates among customers with Fiber optic internet service and higher monthly charges
- Senior citizens with lower tenure are more likely to churn
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates compared to those on longer-term contracts
- Factors such as online security and backup services influence churn rates

**Directory Structure**:
- `customer_churn_analysis/`
  - `churn_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
  - `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis
  - `visualizations/`: Directory containing generated plots and charts

This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and factors affecting churn in the telecommunications industry. The findings can be used to develop targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Future Projects
I plan to add more projects in the future, including but not limited to:
- Data analysis projects using real-world datasets
- Machine learning projects
- Advanced data visualization projects

Stay tuned for updates!
